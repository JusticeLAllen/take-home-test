# take-home-test
Welcome! 

This take home test will be split into sub-folders that are relevant to the steps provided. Each folder will have the necessary materials. Thank you in advance for any time spent reviewing! :^)

With that being said, here's some addl. context:
  - I've decided that it would be easier/more productive to work on this if I had at least a rudimentary SQL console to run queries through. In that vein I wrote a Python script that does just that! `temp-db.py` is written using only vanilla modules in Python - it should be runnable* for anyone already set up on Python
    * ***Runnable** is the operative word here, how the formatting will look is dependent on which version of tkinter you're running. If all goes well, it will also spit out the results in an admittedly ugly form. Function  over beauty!*
  - `temp-sql-console.py` is running on **sqlite** *(since it's endemic to Python)* but the bulk of the work at my day job is in **Snowflake**. In the spirit of being thorough, I'll include two versions of any SQL written. Feel free to only look at the Snowflake versions! Sqlite is a good bit fussier than other SQL languages so the Snowflake will surely be easier to read.
  
Thank you again!
