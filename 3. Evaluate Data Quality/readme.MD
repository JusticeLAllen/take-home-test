In reviewing the data provided, I noticed that receipt items rarely tie back to brands. In reality this might be because this is sample data and I'm not sure that it was meant to actually be queried against.

But in the context of a workplace, my hunch would be that the Brands table is missing information. Maybe one of the API calls failed, maybe there was an outage right before an extract.
